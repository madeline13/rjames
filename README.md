An R project in progress with natural language processing

Before I visualize anything, I had to get the computer to tease out underlying premises and conclusions from, not the sentiments themselves, but using sentiment level as a launching pad for two different kinds of analysis (see description of the file sentiment_baseline.r).

I have almost solved the problem of visualizing this data set from Project Gutenberg.
I have to now show it in more digestible chunks.
